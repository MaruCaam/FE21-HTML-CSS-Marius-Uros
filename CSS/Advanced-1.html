                    <p>Sephiroth is the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII Remake and one of the major antagonists in
                    its extended universe. In spin-off appearances, Sephiroth is depicted as Cloud Strife's archenemy and is seen as a
                    symbol of Clouds troubled past that haunts him. Sephiroth is a former renowned SOLDIER who became twisted.
                    
                    Before his fall from grace, Sephiroth was one of the most lauded success stories of the Shinra Electric Power Company's
                    SOLDIER program. His successes in the field of battle during the conflicts surrounding Shinras bid for global
                    domination led to his status as a celebrity war hero and the poster boy for both the Shinra Military and the company's
                    SOLDIER program. Learning of his true origins drove him insane, causing him to be driven by a desire to destroy the
                    world.
                    
                    Sephiroth is briefly a party member during a flashback in the original Final Fantasy VII, and is both the penultimate
                    and final boss.</p>
                    <p>Prior to his madness, as shown in Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-, Sephiroth maintains an outwardly aloof and
                    professional demeanor during his time at Shinra, known for hardly mingling with anyone but his friends Angeal Hewley and
                    Genesis Rhapsodos, and being indifferent toward his fans. He can act humane and caring in contrast to his reputation,
                    befriending Zack over their shared reluctance to hunt down their friends and desire to bring them back, and asking Cloud
                    how he felt to be back in his hometown, having no familiarity with the emotion himself. Sephiroth is intelligent and
                    respects those he deems worthyâ€”he considers Professor Gast a great scientist, but scorns Professor Hojo. Well-spoken and
                    graceful, Sephiroth is calm, collected, and in control, and has a dry sense of humor. Rarely, he can be frustrated and
                    caught off-guard. As the strongest SOLDIER alive, Sephiroth is confident to the point of arrogance, yet has no interest
                    in personal glory, as he tells Genesis, who envies Sephiroth's reputation, that he can have it.
                    
                    After learning of the experiments that led to his birth, Sephiroth falls into insanity, becoming murderous, ruthless and
                    vengeful, yet retaining his calm and cold demeanor. He develops a messiah complex, proclaiming to be "the chosen one"
                    destined to lead the planet. He becomes sadistic and enjoys mentally torturing Cloud. Sephiroth is devoted to Jenova and
                    her cause, even though her body serves as little more than his avatar. He has become an agent carrying out Jenova's
                    will.
                    
                    In the Japanese releases, Sephiroth uses the pronoun ore prior to his insanity, a common masculine pronoun used by
                    confident males. Following the Nibelheim Incident, he begins to use watashi, a more formal pronoun that is genderless in
                    formal context, likely because he now sees himself as superior to everyone else. This post-madness mannerism carries
                    into his spin-off appearances, such as Dissidia Final Fantasy. In the Remake, Sephiroth uses ore at the ending, as he
                    states he will not let himself end, though all other interactions has him use watashi.</p>

                                                    Sephiroth, where the player can command as many as three parties to bring all of his parts down.</p>

                                                <p>Sephiroth is a tall man with a muscular build. His long silver hair has bangs parted to either side of his face.
